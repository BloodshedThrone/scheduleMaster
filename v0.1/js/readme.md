This is the heart of the entire project.

events.js is an ignorable file. Go to HTML/eventManager.html and you'll know what I mean.

input.js and scheduleMaster.js are...basically the reason why I added this to github.

scheduleMaster.js is the actual algorith that makes the table and input.js is the file in which the user can enter the necessary teachers,
sessions, subjects and number of classes per week.
